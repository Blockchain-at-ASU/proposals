# Events

### Types of events

1. **#educational**
    
    Educational events are those which are designed to impart blockchain-related knowledge. They are a good avenue for showing members how to apply blockchain technology and concepts to the real world.
    
2. **#discord-session**
    
    “Discord session” is a broad term that is used to describe any planned or unplanned event which takes place on discord. Some meetings are better suited to take place on discord. For example, our members will sometimes use the discord voice chat to discuss yield farming strategies and DeFi protocols. This tag can be used for planning events on discord.
    
3. **#seminar**
    
    Seminars are gatherings for the purpose of discussing a stated topic. Typically, such events include a guest speaker with industry experience. The guest-speaker might discuss a specific blockchain subject, share insight from their professional experience, or open the floor up for discussion with individuals in attendance.
    
4. **#social**
    
    Social events are those which are less focused and more laidback. The purpose of these events is for members to get to know one another better, which is important for the sake of strengthening the club community.
    
5. **#conference**
    
    The conference tag will be used for:
    
    - Planning a conference

    Similar to #conference, the hackathon tag can be used for:

### Proposing an event

- To propose an idea for an event, submit an “Event Proposal” on Discourse.  This should be posted under the “Governance” category and “Event Planning” subcategory.
- The request should include tags #event, #proposal, and #(event type). It is possible for there to be some overlap with event types. In the case of overlap, include tags for all related event types. For example, if I am planning an educational event on Discord, I would tag both #educational and #discord-session.
- Use the template below for formatting your event request.
