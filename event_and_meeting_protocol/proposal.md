# [Proposal] Event and Meeting Planning Protocol

Created: January 20, 2022 9:17 AM

# **Summary**

Well-planned events and meetings increase club efficiency and member attendance. They have a positive influence on interpersonal bonds, communication, and productivity within the club. This guide is written for the officers of Blockchain at ASU, to be used as a code of conduct for planning meetings and events.

# **Abstract**

This proposal includes the following:

- A weekly calendar for event and meeting planning.
- Event guidelines
    - Declaration and definition of all event types within the Blockchain at ASU organization.
    - Protocol for proposing an event
    - A formalized template for event proposals.
- Meeting guidelines
    - Declaration and definition of all structured meeting types within the Blockchain at ASU organization.
    - Agenda structure and officer responsibilities for Blockchain at ASU officer meetings.
    - Agenda structure and officer responsibilities for Blockchain at ASU Clubsensus meetings.

# **Motivation**

The first four months of our club’s journey have put forward some impressive results: we have hosted educational seminars, held workshops, and even hosted a community-wide event with the C-suite of a next-generation decentralized network company. In the coming semesters, we expect to continue expanding the size and reach of our club and its events.

As our organization continues to improve, member participation will increase, further establishing our voice within the ASU and broader web3 community. There are two areas of improvement which will facilitate this growth: putting effective planning strategies into action, and consistently raising the bar for a high level of excellence. By putting this protocol into practice, we will have set our sights on ever high standards. Our combined efforts towards this common goal will bring tremendous value to our club members.

Through experience, we now know much more about what it takes to plan a meeting or event than when Blockchain at ASU was founded. Still, there is much to learn. Though this protocol promotes a smoother means of organization, there are still sure to be stumbling blocks. Such is only human. Possible challenges we might face include miscommunication, interpersonal conflict, and the learning curve which accompanies a new way of doing things. Together, we can continue to overcome these hurdles and strive towards greatness. I’m incredibly proud of everyone at Blockchain at ASU for their tireless efforts to educate, research, and promote blockchain technology across the Arizona State community.

# **Specification**

[Event and Meeting Protocol](https://github.com/Blockchain-at-ASU/proposals/blob/main/event_and_meeting_protocol/event_and_meeting_protocol.md)

# **Benefits**

- In the heart of decentralization, this model makes use of our Discourse to promote the transparency of our organization.
- Well-planned meetings and events boost attendance and member satisfaction.
- A strict weekly calendar mitigates event overlap by assigning types of events to different days (i.e. a hackathon will not overlap with an educational seminar). This structure also makes it easier when we are looking to plan events with companies. Providing them with a list of dates we are sure to be available is more efficient than coming to one arbitrarily.
- Using a parliamentary structure for Clubsensus meetings establishes the legitimacy of our organization and sets a professional tone.
- Preparing topics of discussion ahead of time will make for more effective, efficient, and agreeable officer meetings.
- Our event proposal template can be extended to companies, individuals, and other groups that are interested in hosting an event with us.

# **Drawbacks**

- Our current model for planning events and meetings is casual and unstructured. The new system, with a higher standard of formalities, might be awkward to adjust to.
- The new model introduces demands on the secretary which have not previously been present in the club. The secretary should consider these new responsibilities. If they are too much work, our club’s officers can find a way to delegate tasks more evenly.
- This model will require some configuration work on the Discourse.

# **Vote**

**For**: The proposed protocol for event and meeting planning will be put into action immediately.

**Against**: The proposed protocol for event and meeting planning will not be put into place.
