# Planning Effective Meetings

# Overview

Well planned meetings increase club efficiency and member attendance. They also have a positive influence on interpersonal bonds, communication, and productivity within the club. This guide is written for the officers of Blockchain at ASU, to be used as a code of conduct for planning meetings.

# Meeting guidelines

Meetings provide an opportunity for members to:

- Communicate club happenings
- Evaluate project and event progress
- Plan for upcoming events and projects

### Before the meeting

- Ensure that the meeting is really needed
- Plan the meeting in advance
- Never substitute a meeting for action
- Establish the goal of the meeting with the officers so they can effectively help the rest of the membership understand

### **Officer preparation duties**

- Create and make available a written agenda
- Prepare the meeting room
- Ensure the presence of a presiding officer (president or vice president)
- Practice opening and closing ceremonies
- Invite the appropriate people
- Last meeting’s minutes, treasurers report, or other reports

### **Meeting logistics**

- Start and end on time
- Establish a positive mood
- Post and use meeting ground rules
- Encourage all members to participate
- Record meeting minutes to track meeting decisions and ensure members complete their respective duties

### Parliamentary procedure

Using correct parliamentary procedures will ensure meeting efficiency and effectiveness. 

- Parliamentary procedure has several benefits:
    - Only one person presides over the meeting and enforces the rules
    - Members can focus their attention since only one topic is discussed at a time during the meetings
    - All members have an equal opportunity to share thoughts and ideas
    - The rule of the majority is observed, and the rights of the minority are respected

### Meeting agenda and minutes

For each meeting, there will be a discourse topic for that meeting.

- Before the meeting it is an agenda
- After the meeting it becomes the minutes

# Officer meetings

### **Purpose**

This is the designated time for officers to share their plans and ideas with other officer members.

### Officer preparation duties

- Every Monday after the preceding Officer meeting, the secretary creates a new topic in the “Governance” category under the “Event Planning” subcategory. The title will be “Officer meeting MM/DD/YYYY”, where the meeting date is included in the topic title. The tags will be **#meeting** and **#officer**
- The topic is set to close on the date of the meeting which is in the title at the time the meeting is set to begin.
- There should be a discord reminder sent to the board including a link to the meeting’s specific topic URL.
- Officers will create posts within the topic for each item which is to be discussed at the meeting.

### Meeting agenda and minutes

- During the officer meeting, the president or vice president will step through each topic which was posted in the meeting topic for that week.
- The sequence of posts is the sequence of discussion.
- Following the meeting, the secretary should edit the topic to include the minutes from that meeting.

# Clubsensus (club member meetings)

### **Purpose**

- To communicate important and necessary information to club members. When members are well-informed about opportunities within the club, they are more likely to take action on those opportunities.
- To establish a community environment among club members. Members can begin working towards common goals when they see the contributions that others will make for the same purpose.

### Officer preparation duties

- Every Monday after the preceding Clubsensus meeting, the secretary creates a new topic in the “Governance” category under the “Event Planning” subcategory. The title will be “Clubsensus MM/DD/YYYY”, where the meeting date is included in the topic title. The tags will be **#meeting** and **#clubsensus**
